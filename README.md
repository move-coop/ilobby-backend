## OVERVIEW
iLobby is a tool to explore, select and take action towards state-level legislators in the United States.

This backend is an API that pulls data from the openstates.org API.

The frontend can be found here: https://github.com/jasmosez/ilobby-frontend. It visualizes legislative districts using the Google Maps Javascript API.

You will need your own API keys for both.

## Ruby/Rails versions
Uses Ruby 2.6.1 and Rails 6.0.2.2

## Configuration
create an .env file in the root directory defining `OS_KEY` as your open states API key

## Database creation
### Migrate the database
rails db:migrate

### Seed the database
rails db:seed

Note that /db/seeds.rb contains, but does not use some methods for parsing collections of legislator twitter handles and exporting user data as csv files. To date this is all being done in an ad hoc fashion.

## How to run the test suite
There is not test coverage at this time

## Current Deployment(s)
It is currently deployed at https://ilobby.thisjames.com
